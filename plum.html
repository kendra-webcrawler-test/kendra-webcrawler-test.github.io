<h1>Plum</h1>
<p>
Plums may have been one of the first fruits domesticated by humans.[2] Three of the most abundantly cultivated species are not found in the wild, only around human settlements: Prunus domestica has been traced to East European and Caucasian mountains, while Prunus salicina and Prunus simonii originated in China. Plum remains have been found in Neolithic age archaeological sites along with olives, grapes and figs.[3][4] According to Ken Albala, plums originated in Iran.[5] They were brought to Britain from Asia.[6]

An article on plum tree cultivation in Andalusia (southern Spain) appears in Ibn al-'Awwam's 12th-century agricultural work, Book on Agriculture
